# Scrape-and-analyze-data-analyst-job-requirements

In this project, we'll build a web scraper to extract job listings from Turkish famoust job search platform (kariyer.net)
We'll extract job information such as (Ad Link, Position, Location, Work Model, Work Type, Position Level, Department, Sectors, Benfits, Criteria, and some relevant information).

In date of data extraction I got (28,175) Row of information.
I start to get the link of Ad from Page of Ads List which named (is-ilanlari) and go through inside each page of Ads to get the information about each Ad.

- Also, I included the file of the job requirements and it named (job_final.xlsx) and it has all provided information about each Ad.
